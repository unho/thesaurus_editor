            <p>{% blocktrans %}There are several available relationship types:{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            </ul>
            
            <p>{% blocktrans %}For each kind of relationship type, a given word can have several different relationships or meanings, which in fact correspond to different concepts.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            
            
            <h5>{% blocktrans %}Getting words{% endblocktrans %}</h5>
            <p>{% blocktrans %}You can get words to relate from two sources:{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>{% blocktrans %}Searching for a word by using the «Search» form.{% endblocktrans %}</li>
                <li>{% blocktrans %}Go to the «Suggestions» tab for getting machine-suggested (based on word similarity) or user-suggested words.{% endblocktrans %} <div class="alert alert-error">{% blocktrans %}NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!{% endblocktrans %}</div></li>
            </ul>

            <p>{% blocktrans %}Click in any list item for marking it as active and use any of the the buttons or keyboard shortcuts for performing an action.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            
            
            <h5>{% blocktrans %}Search behavior{% endblocktrans %}</h5>
            <p>{% blocktrans %}The live search will start working when at least 3 characters are typed in the search field. If you want to force a search for a word with less than 3 characters you may hit the 'Enter' key in your keyboard or press the 'Search' button.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            
            <p>{% blocktrans %}In the case that some previous results are shown, but less than 3 characters are typed, for example by deleting some of the characters that originated the search results, the results wouldn't be refreshed unless explicitly forced by hitting the 'Enter' key or pressing the 'Search' button. Anyway, when the search field is empty the search results will be flushed away automatically.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            
            
            <h5>{% blocktrans %}Adding new meanings{% endblocktrans %}</h5>
            <p>{% blocktrans %}As is told a few lines above, each word can have up to three kinds of relationships, and for each of these kinds of relationships it might have several meanings, were every particular meaning corresponds to a different concept.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            
            <p>{% blocktrans %}Once a list of available words is displayed, for example after searching, you may navigate it and create a new meaning in which the current word and the active word in the word list are put together. This can be done by pressing the appropiated key on the keyboard while the desired word is active in the word list.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            
            
            <h5>{% blocktrans %}Adding a word to an existing meaning{% endblocktrans %}</h5>
            <p>{% blocktrans %}In order to add a word to an existing meaning is necessary to have a selected meaning. Once such a meaning exists you only have to select an active word in the search results, and press the appropiate shortcut keys to add the word to the selected meaning.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            
            <p>{% blocktrans %}If no meaning is selected, nothing will happen when trying to add the active word to the selected meaning.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            
            <p>{% blocktrans %}Note that if the selected meaning is an antonym meaning, and you press the shortcut keys for adding the active word as a synonym in the selected antonym meaning, nothing will happen. The same goes for any combination of a given selected meaning and adding the active word as another kind of relationship.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            
            
            <h5>{% blocktrans %}Importing words{% endblocktrans %}</h5>
            <p>{% blocktrans %}Thesaurus editor allows to import new words by providing them in a text file, UTF-8 encoded, with one word per line. In order to perform the import you should go to the import page, select the file in the form and push the 'Import' button.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            
            <p>{% blocktrans %}Note that depending of how many words are in the file it could take a while to import all of them, so be patient.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            
            <p><span class="label label-important">{% blocktrans %}Important{% endblocktrans %}</span> {% blocktrans %}Remember that the files should be UTF-8 encoded!{% endblocktrans %}</p>
