            <p>Thesaurus-editor allows you to import words, stablish relationships between words, and export this data.</p>
            
            <h5>Word relationships</h5>
            <p>There are several available relationship types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Synonym</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Antonym</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Related:</strong> for stablishing another kind of relationship.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>For each kind of relationship type, a given word can have several different relationships or meanings, which in fact correspond to different concepts.</p>
            
            
            <h5>Getting words</h5>
            <p>You can get words to relate from two sources:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Searching for a word by using the «Search» form.</li>
                <li>Go to the «Suggestions» tab for getting machine-suggested (based on word similarity) or user-suggested words. <div class="alert alert-error">NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!</div></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Click in any list item for marking it as active and use any of the the buttons or keyboard shortcuts for performing an action.</p>
            
            
            <h4>Keyboard shortcuts</h4>
            <p>For quicker usage you can perform actions by using your keyboard.</p>
